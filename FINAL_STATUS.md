## 🚀 Quick Start (Choose One Method)

### Method 1: Automated Startup (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/factorial/Programming/spam-classifier
python3 start_app.py
```

### Method 2: Manual Startup
```bash
cd /Users/factorial/Programming/spam-classifier
python3 app.py
```

### Method 3: Direct Test
```bash
cd /Users/factorial/Programming/spam-classifier
python3 demo.py
```

## 🌐 Web Interface

Once the server starts, you'll see output like:
```
Starting server on port 5001
* Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5001
* Running on http://192.168.1.100:5001
```

**Open your browser to the URL shown** (typically `http://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`)

## 🎯 Test Examples

Try these in the web interface:

**Spam Examples:**
- `WINNER! You've won $1000! Click here NOW to claim your prize!`
- `URGENT! Your account will be suspended unless you verify immediately!`
- `FREE MONEY! No strings attached! Call now!!!`

**Ham Examples:**
- `Hey, how are you doing today? Hope everything is well.`
- `Don't forget about the meeting tomorrow at 2 PM.`
- `Thanks for your help with the project yesterday.`
